    This was just a small project give by my sir. And here where it wentcrazy when me and friend get into it so badly that we felt like we are currently owning a company. Where I have groupn of people working under me.<br><br>
    I started telling all my group mates let's make this project as it is a real company and we are a part of these company. In such a focus and dedication we started our work.
    <br><br>
    I divided my work into differnt parts. Wherein I told one of my friend to work into editing. Other guys to know about the product that our company is going to sell. This work I gave 2 of them.
