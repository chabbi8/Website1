    I used to love playing anytime anywhere, I know it sounds funny but it was reality. I'll tell you guys my schedule during childhood. In morning, I used to go to the school after coming back from school I used to go for tuition, around 5 I used to finish off my tuitions than me and my brother come home as fast as we can than we both run to the playing ground .
